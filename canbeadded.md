Based on the provided codebase, here are several ideas we could add to enhance the project:

1. **Search & Filter Functionality**

- Add a search bar to filter resources by name, description, or tags
- Implement advanced filtering by multiple categories (difficulty level, type, language)

```typescript
// Example structure:
interface Resource {
  ...existing fields...
  tags: string[];
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  language?: string[];
}
```

2. **User Interaction Features**

3. **Enhanced Resource Display**

- Add resource cards with preview images/thumbnails
- Implement a grid/list view toggle
- Add a "Recently Added" section
- Show resource popularity metrics (views, saves, ratings)

4. **Learning Paths**

- Create curated learning paths combining multiple resources
- Add progress tracking for learning paths
- Implement skill trees or knowledge graphs
- Add prerequisites and related resources

5. **Social Features**

10. **Integration Features**

- Add calendar integration for course schedules
